# Eligibility Scoring: The Story Behind Each Metric

When determining eligibility for social support, we believe in transparency and empathy. Each point in your eligibility score is carefully considered to reflect your unique circumstances. Here’s a detailed story explaining how each metric is evaluated and why it matters:

## 1. Income: Supporting Those Who Need It Most

Your monthly income is a key indicator of your financial situation. The lower your income (relative to the eligibility threshold), the more points you receive. This is because we want to prioritize applicants who have less financial means. If your income is just above the threshold, you do not receive points for this metric, but you are not penalized. However, if your income is unusually high (above AED 15,000), a small negative score is applied. This ensures that support is directed to those who truly need it, and prevents high earners from receiving benefits meant for the vulnerable.

**Example:**
- If your income is AED 8,000 and the threshold is AED 10,000, you receive a high score for this metric.
- If your income is AED 16,000, you receive a small penalty, reflecting that your financial need is less urgent.

## 2. Employment Status: Recognizing All Circumstances

We understand that employment is not always a choice. Whether you are employed, unemployed, or in a precarious job, your status is taken into account. Stable employment receives some points, but those who are unemployed or in unstable jobs may receive more, acknowledging their greater need for support.

**Example:**
- If you are unemployed, you receive more points for this metric.
- If you are employed in a stable job, you receive a moderate score.

## 3. Family Size: Acknowledging Greater Responsibility

Larger families face greater financial responsibilities. If your family size meets or exceeds a certain threshold, you receive additional points. This ensures that families with more dependents are given priority, as their needs are often greater.

**Example:**
- A family of 5 receives more points than a single individual or a couple.

## 4. Financial Need: Looking Beyond Income

We look at your total assets and liabilities to understand your true financial position. If your liabilities outweigh your assets, or your asset-to-liability ratio is low, you receive more points. This highlights financial vulnerability that may not be visible from income alone.

**Example:**
- If you have significant debts compared to your assets, you receive a higher score for this metric.

## 5. Credit Score: Considering Financial History

A higher credit score earns more points, but we do not exclude those with lower scores. This metric helps us understand your financial reliability, but it is only one part of the bigger picture.

**Example:**
- If your credit score is above the minimum threshold, you receive full points for this metric.
- If it is below, you still receive some points, as we recognize that credit history can be affected by many factors.
